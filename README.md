## ‚öôÔ∏è End-to-End Pipeline

### 1. Data Acquisition
- Real-time sensors:
  - WOB (Weight on Bit)
  - RPM (Revolutions per Minute)
  - Torque
  - Delta P
  - Flow rate
- Historical logs:
  - Gamma ray, resistivity
  - Inclination and azimuth
  - Bottom Hole Pressure (BHP)
- Operational conditions:
  - Mud type and density
  - Bottom Hole Assembly (BHA)
  - Geological formation
  - Connection and tripping times

### 2. Data Preprocessing
- Data cleaning and outlier removal
- Interpolation and resampling for uniform frequency
- Scaling and normalization (StandardScaler / MinMaxScaler)
- Feature engineering:
  - Mechanical Specific Energy (MSE)
  - ROP derivatives (dROP/dt)
  - Combinations of WOB, RPM, and Torque

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Correlation analysis between parameters and ROP
- Identification of anomalous conditions: vibrations, stuck pipe
- Visualization: histograms, boxplots, time series

### 4. Modeling
- Classical models:
  - Linear Regression
  - Random Forest / XGBoost
- Deep Learning:
  - LSTM / GRU for time series
  - Informer / Transformer for long sequences
- Hybrid models: ML + physical equations (MSE, Bingham)

### 5. Training and Validation
- Split data by wells: train / validation / test
- Time-series cross-validation
- Metrics: RMSE, MAE, R¬≤
- Hyperparameter tuning (GridSearch / Optuna)

### 6. Deployment
- Export model: `pickle`, `joblib` or `ONNX`
- Integration in real-time dashboard (Streamlit / Dash / FastAPI)
- Alerts for operators: ‚ÄúIncrease WOB 10% to improve ROP‚Äù
- Connection to SCADA or field control systems

### 7. Monitoring and Maintenance
- Continuous model performance monitoring
- Periodic retraining with new well data
- Detection of data drift due to changes in lithology, mud, or BHA
